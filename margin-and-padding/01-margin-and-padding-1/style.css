Simply edit the `style.css` file so that 
the divs look like the image below.

You should only have to change the values 
of the margin and padding for this exercise.

You should not have to add or remove properties in the CSS, or touch the HTML.

padding: inside the box.
border: the border of the box.
margin: outside the box.

Auto property explained:

A block-level element with height: auto 
will grow taller as it contains more text.

A block element with margin: 0 auto 
will have the left and right margins increased until it becomes centered 
along the y-axis of the viewport.

Block vs inline:

Block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, 
each new element starting on a new line.

Most of the elements their default style is display: block.

Inline elements, do not start on a new line. 
They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside.

Padding and margin behave differently on inline elements.

In general, you do not want to try to put extra padding or margin 
on inline elements.
