---------TASK-------------

For this one you will need to edit the HTML a little bit too.

You'll want to add containers around the various elements 
so that you can flex them.

---------TASK-------------

This was also easy, i solved it a bit differently as the solution 
but its still the same....

The dude just put a text-align: center at the body, that was intelligent...
With that not only text, but the images from plants were centered...{

I went another route... putting display: flex, justify-content: center,
at the title and placing text-align at each item with .plants...

Also i used width, instead of max-width, but it didn't changed at all..

The rest was the exactly the same as the solution...

Im getting the hang of it, is very simple with practice...

And yes, to my question a couple of exercises back...

I should only flex on the parent most of the times...
